# lruCacheStats

`fun lruCacheStats(): `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)

This is only public so that we can publish stats. Accessing this requires casting
[HeapGraph](../-heap-graph/index.md) to [HprofHeapGraph](index.md) so it's really not a public API. May change at any time!
